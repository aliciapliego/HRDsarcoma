# RNAseq expression 

Gene expression download RSEM and normalize within sample to a fixed upper quartile. (workflow: https://gdcapi.nci.nih.gov/legacy/data/e34a93ee-d3c4-44c7-8bfa-0c19c6df0866)

Filter genes by removing all genes that had <90% expression data greater than zero across all tumors. 
Expression values log2 transfromed, followed by median centering for each gene across all tumors and for all genes within each tumor, respectively.

Genes were filtered to 2,038 by selecting genes with a standard deviation across all tumors >= 2. 
**Does it make sense??

Maybe also try to do it in the samples of the upper and lower quartiles.
